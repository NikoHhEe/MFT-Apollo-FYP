\label{ch:related_work} 

This chapter gives two (or more) related researches of autonomous vehicle testing and the methodologies and results of these researches. New thoughts in my project and better approaches than existing work in the same field are introduced.

\section{Metamorphic Fuzz Testing on Autonomous Vehicles}
Apart from methodology and results, explain the advantages of the project. Give extra information about potential drawback and how to avoid or optimise it.

\section{Metamorphic Testing of Driverless Cars}
Same as previous section...

\section{Innovative MRs and Improvements}
Introduce different thoughts, design, new MRs and testing approaches that is better than the existing experiments.
