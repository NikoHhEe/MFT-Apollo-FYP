\chapter{Results and Analysis}
\label{ch:result}

This chapter presents the different testing results of several round of simulations. The results are analysed and the MRs and fuzz function are evaluated.

\section{Testing Results}
Based on a certain amount of experiments, summarize the testing results in a table. Critical information includes candidate failure rates and genuine failure rates. Determine the seriousness of the problem according to the genuine failure rate. Give some reasoning and analysis about the season of the failure.

\section{MR/MT Evaluation}
Based on the results, reflect on how well the MRs are used to undercover problems in Apollo system. Discuss how can the MRs be improved to perform better.

\section{Fuzz Function Evaluation}
Based on the results, reflect on how well the fuzz function is implemented to generate effective test cases to the simulation environment in Apollo system. Discuss how the fuzz function is improved during the testing process and how it can be improved in the future.

\section{Summary of MFT on Apollo}
Summarize the effectiveness of MFT applied on Apollo autonomous driving systems. Discuss the possibility of testing other self driving software using MFT.
